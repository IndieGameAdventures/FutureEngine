FutureEngine
============

A free, open source game engine for Windows, Linux, and hopefully others.

This engine will support 2D and 3D applications, specifically games, on as many platforms as possible.
Future Engine will attempt to be as light weight as possible while still getting the job done.

Modules will include-
- FutureCore
- FutureMath
- FuturePhysics
- FutureGraphics
- FutureAnimation
- FutureParticles
- FutureAI
- FutureNetwork
- FutureWorlds
 

Android support will be added after v1.0 for Windows/Linux is complete
Ouya support will be added upon its release.
There is potential for iOS and Mac to be added at a later time.
Additional consoles (PS3, PS4, Wii, Wii U, PSP, PS Vita) will not be added as Sony and Nintendo do not release SDKs to the general public.
